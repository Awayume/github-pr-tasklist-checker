# GitHub PR Tasklist Checker
An Action to check if the PR tasklist is complete.

### Tag Policy
Tags always start with 'v' and refer to the version. Those tags are always immutable.  
There are also tags for major version and minor version (v1.0, v2.0, etc.),
tags for major versions only (v1, v2, etc.), and "latest" tags.  
The first two types of tags refer to the latest version starting with their name, the last type of tag refers to the latest version in the repository.
